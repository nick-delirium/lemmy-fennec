#### (Previously: Fennec for Lemmy)

Minimalistic and easy to use Lemmy client written for general public enjoyment, my personal experience and RN skills improvement.
I hope that it will be easy and fun to use for everyone, including people with impaired vision abilities.

# Installation
**With [Obtanium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases):** download [Obtanium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases), then go to "Add App", type in "https://github.com/nick-delirium/lemmy-fennec/" to the first field and add the app. Voila! Now you will get all new releases automatically or notified about it if you will chose "track only" mode.

**Manual download:**
[Latest release](https://github.com/nick-delirium/lemmy-fennec/releases/latest)

# Why React Native? 

Very easy to start with, easy to contribute and runs super well with new Hermes engine (almost no difference vs flutter in performance). This app outputs 120 fps and I'm looking into every possible option to optimize it when I'm adding something.

# Want to help, found any bad code or bugs? 

Start a PR or issue, I'll be happy to see it. Same for feature requests.
