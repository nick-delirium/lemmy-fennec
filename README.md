Minimalistic and easy to use Lemmy client written for general user enjoyment and my RN skills improvement, aimed at inclusivity for people with impaired vision abilities.

Why React Native? Very easy to start with, easy to contribute and runs super well with new Hermes engine (almost no difference vs flutter).

Why comment and post liking is slow? Lemmy API is barely alive because of too many users and is sometimes slow.

Spot any bad code or bugs? Start a PR or issue, I'll be happy to see it.
Same for feature requests.

todo:
- comments
- writing comment/post
- profile editing
- more settings for app behavior
- sublemmy (community) view
- different user views
- search
