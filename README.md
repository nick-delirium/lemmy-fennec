Minimalistic and easy to use Lemmy client written for general user enjoyment and my RN skills improvement, hopefully easy and fun to use, including people with impaired vision abilities.

# Why React Native? 

Very easy to start with, easy to contribute and runs super well with new Hermes engine (almost no difference vs flutter).

# Why comment and post liking is slow? 

Lemmy API is barely alive because of too many users and is sometimes slow.

# Spot any bad code or bugs? 

Start a PR or issue, I'll be happy to see it. Same for feature requests.
