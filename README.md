Minimalistic and easy to use Lemmy client written for general user enjoyment and my RN skills improvement, aimed at inclusivity for people with impaired vision abilities.

Why React Native? Very easy to start with, easy to contribute and runs super well with new Hermes engine (almost no difference vs flutter).

Spot any bad code or bugs? Start a PR or issue, I'll be happy to see it.
Same for feature requests.
